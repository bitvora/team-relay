## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based operating system
- Docker installed on your system
- Go installed on your system

## Setting Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.

2.  Add your environment variables to the `.env` file. For example:

    ```env

    RELAY_NAME="Bitvora"
    RELAY_PUBKEY="8ad8f1f78c8e11966242e28a7ca15c936b23a999d5fb91bfe4e4472e2d6eaf55"
    RELAY_DESCRIPTION="Bitvora Team Relay"

    POSTGRES_USER=bitvora
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    POSTGRES_DB=relay
    POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
    POSTGRES_PORT=5437

    TEAM_DOMAIN="bitvora.com"

    ```

## Running Docker

1. Run Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Compiling the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitvora/team-relay.git
   cd team-relay
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```bash
   go build -o team-relay
   ```

## Running the Application as a Service

1. Create a systemd service file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/team-relay.service
   ```

2. Add the following content to the service file: (update paths and usernames as needed)

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Team Relay
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/path/to/yourappname
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/team-relay
   EnvironmentFile=/path/to/team-relay/.env
   Restart=always
   User=ubuntu

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Reload the systemd daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. Enable and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable team-relay
   sudo systemctl start team-relay
   ```

5. Check the status of the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status team-relay
   ```

## Conclusion

Your team relay will be running at localhost:3334. Feel free to serve it with nginx or any other reverse proxy.
